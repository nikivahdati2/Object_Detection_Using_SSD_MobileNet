        "- Observe the bounding boxes. Are there any instances where the boxes are inaccurate or miss the object entirely? What factors in the images might be contributing to these errors?\n",

        "- If you wanted to train your own object detection model, what steps would you need to take? What are some challenges you might encounter?\n",
